Type `make build-libvirt` and follow the instructions.

Try the example guest:

# Kickstart

The Fedora installation iso uses the Anaconda installer to install Fedora.
During the installation it will ask you some questions and it will also
store your anwsers in the `/root/anaconda-ks.cfg` (aka kickstart) file.
This file is later used to fully automate a new installation by specifying
its location in the `inst.ks` kernel command line argument.
